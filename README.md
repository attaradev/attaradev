# 👋 Hi, I’m Mike Attara

**Human-centric Software Engineer** with a background in teaching science and mathematics. I architect and build resilient backend systems and scalable platforms — crafting intuitive, user-friendly products that solve real-world problems. I’m driven by thoughtful design, cross-functional collaboration, and a lifelong commitment to learning and growth.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧱 Design and build distributed systems and modern web applications  
- 🛠 Develop clean, scalable backend architecture using **Ruby on Rails**, **NestJS**, and **Spring Boot**  
- 🎨 Craft responsive frontends with **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**  
- 🚢 Deploy to production using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS** (Certified Cloud Practitioner 👨🏾‍💻, currently preparing for the Solutions Architect certification)  
- ⚙️ Set up robust CI/CD workflows with **GitHub Actions**, **CircleCI**, **Helm**, and **ArgoCD**

## 🧠 What I Value

- 🛠 Crafting systems that are scalable, maintainable, and user-focused  
- 🤝 Working with people in cross-functional teams  
- 🎙 Sharing knowledge through workshops, meetups, and open-source contributions  
- 🌍 Growing inclusive developer communities through [GDG Accra](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-accra/), [FOSUniverse](https://fosuniverse.org), [DjangoGirls](https://djangogirls.org/), and [RailsGirls](https://railsgirls.com)  
- 🌱 Embracing new technologies and tools when they better solve real-world problems

## 📌 Currently

- 🔭 Building backend systems to streamline equipment appraisal workflows at [Purple Wave Auction](https://purplewave.com)  
- 🎓 Deepening my expertise in **software architecture**, **cloud-native engineering best practices**, and **technology leadership & entrepreneurship**

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

- 💼 Open to conversations around impactful **backend**, **full-stack**, or **developer advocacy** opportunities  
  > While I’m not actively job hunting, I’m open to the right opportunity — especially one aligned with my passion for resilient systems and community-driven technology.

- 💬 Ask me about: designing scalable systems with `Rails`, `NestJS`, or `Spring Boot`; building modern UIs with `React`; developing `microservices` and APIs; improving `developer experience`; or contributing to `open source` projects and communities
